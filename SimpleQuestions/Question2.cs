//Q:
//2. How does the header of the class definition look like?
//MyClass<int> myInstance = new MyClass<int>();

//A:
//I am unsure what this question is supposed to mean. While C++ uses header files, C# doesn't.
//Assuming this means "What does the class definition look like in code?":

//public class MyClass<T>
//{
//    code here, e.g. "private T? myVariable;"
//}
