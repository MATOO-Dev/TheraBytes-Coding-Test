//Q:
//4. What are the results of the following operation (binary and decimal)?
//12 AND 55
//12 OR 55
//12 XOR 55

//A:
//Assuming "binary and decimal" means both input values and the result value are all binary or decimal respectively

//12 AND 55
//Binary: 00
//Decimal: 4

//12 OR 55
//Binary: 01
//Decimal: 63

//12 XOR 55
//Binary: 01
//Decimal: 59

//Assuming "binary/decimal" means both input values are decimal, and the result value is either binary or decimal

//12 AND 55
//Binary: 100
//Decimal: 4

//12 OR 55
//Binary: 111111
//Decimal: 63

//12 XOR 55
//Binary: 111011
//Decimal: 59
